# IMMEDIATE FIX - Your AdminLogin.tsx is Fixed But Not in Git

## The Issue
Your local file is correct but Netlify is building from your GitHub repository which might still have the old version.

## EXACT Steps to Fix Right Now:

1. **Commit and push the fix:**
```bash
git add components/AdminLogin.tsx
git commit -m "Fix sonner import - remove version specification"
git push origin main
```

2. **Trigger Netlify rebuild:**
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click "Deploy" or "Trigger deploy"
- Select "Deploy site"

## What Was Wrong:
- Line 10 in AdminLogin.tsx had: `import { toast } from 'sonner@2.0.3';`
- Should be: `import { toast } from 'sonner';` 
- Your package.json has `"sonner": "^1.5.0"` so the @2.0.3 version was invalid

## Alternative Fix (if git doesn't work):
If you can't commit, edit the file directly in GitHub:
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Navigate to `components/AdminLogin.tsx`
3. Click the edit button (pencil icon)
4. Change line 10 from `import { toast } from 'sonner@2.0.3';` to `import { toast } from 'sonner';`
5. Click "Commit changes"

This will immediately trigger a Netlify rebuild with the correct code.

## Your Next.js Structure is Also Fixed:
- Added `'use client'` to `/app/page.tsx` to fix the server/client component mismatch
- Your CSS import path is correct in layout.tsx

The build should work after this commit + push.
